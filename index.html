                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Version control is when you have one main repository that keeps all your project files. When you have multiple team members they can check their files out of the repository and make changes to their copy. Following this they can commit them back into the main repository that houses all the version of that file. One of the main advantages to using version control is that it solves the file sharing problem that arises when working with multiple other users where files can be deleted or overridden. This helps to share those files while avoiding most problems that go hand in hand with file sharing. </p>

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There once was an open source software project of fairly large scope called the Linux kernel. For most of the maintenance of this software, changes were passed around as patches and archived files. However, in 2002 the project started using a BitKeeper. As they were developing their own tools based on lessons they learned while using BitKeeper, some of the new goals were speed, simple design, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. Since the birth of Git in 2005 it has changed and grown to be an easy to use software that includes all these goals. Git is very fast and efficient with large projects just as hoped!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are usually two ways to obtain a Git repository. First, you can take a local directory that is not under version control and turn it into a Git repository. Or secondly, you can clone an existing Git repository from somewhere else. If your project directory is not under version control you can start controlling it with Git by first locating the project’s directory. Once you find it, you’ll create a subdirectory named .git by typing “$ git init”. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to clone an existing Git repository, the command needed is “git clone”. This gives Git a full copy of almost all data on the server, including every version of every file for the history of the project.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Usually, once you have your Git repository set up you’ll want to make changes and committing snapshots of your changes to the repository once those changes are up to satisfaction. The files in your directory can also be either tracked or untracked. If the files are tracked they are files that were found in the last snapshot. This means that these files can be modified, unmodified, or staged. Untracked files contain basically everything else, they are the files that are not found in your snapshot or your staging area. These are the files that essentially Git doesn’t know about. Git sees files as modified as you continue to edit them due to seeing changes in your last commit. It is a cycle of selectively staging the modified files and committing them to staged changes. </p>

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first thing you needed to sign up for a free Github account is to visit the website https://github.com. When you arrive at the webpage, you’ll be instructed to choose a username, provide and email address and password, and then to continue you’ll press the sign up. Github will send you an email verification that you must go on and click the link the verify your account. You can click on free account when you get to the pricing and plan information page. The next important part in setting up your Github is to acquire SSH access. This is done by opening your account settings using the link at the top-right corner. Following this, select SSH keys and ass SSH key. You’ll then paste the contents of your public-key file into the text box and name the SSH key. Once you click “Add key” you are all set up! </p>
